# Electric Vehicle Dashboard

## Overview
This project aims to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau using electric vehicle population data. The dashboard provides insights into the electric vehicle market, technological advancements, and adoption trends.

## Problem Statements
1. **Total Vehicles:**
   - Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) to assess market size and growth.
2. **Average Electric Range:**
   - Determine the average electric range of vehicles in the dataset to gauge efficiency and technological advancements.
3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:**
   - Identify the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs).
   - Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to all electric vehicles.
4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:**
   - Identify the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
   - Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to all electric vehicles.
